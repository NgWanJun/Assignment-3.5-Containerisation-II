# Assignment-3.5-Containerisation-II
Hello!

This is a multi-container application that uses 2 containers. The first is a node.js app that returns "hello world", and the second
runs an NGINX server. 

When you run `docker-compose up -d` and run localhost, "hello world" will be displayed in the web browser!
